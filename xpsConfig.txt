##

#### HOW TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE csv FILE FOR ANALYSIS
##

#### SELECT DATA TO BE ANALYZED
>>> EdgarEastSpectrum.csv

#### ELEMENTS TO ANALYZE / PEAK CENTERS
## Write in a comma separated list alternating element name and peak center (eV), i.e. 'Fe, 712.5, Mg, 91, O, 535'
## You do not need to specify the atomic transition (e.g. you can write O instead of O1s)
## Write your list of elements and peak centers on the following line:
>>> C, 286.5, O, 533, F, 688, Na, 57.5, Mg, 90.5, Al, 76, Si, 155, P, 135.5, S, 171.5, Cl, 200.5, Cr, 580.5, Fe, 712.5


#### HOW TO OUTPUT PLOTS OF REGION FOR BACKGROUND POINT SELECTION
## To output plots of background point regions, run the file 'Region.py' in the terminal, with the command given below
## Please review the selected regions, if you wish to change them manually, see the following section
>>> python Region.py


#### MANUALLY SET BACKGROUND REGION HERE
## To manually set a region, include the following information 'Element_Name, Low_Or_High_Region, Starting_Energy, Ending_Energy'
## Include the name of the element, identical to how you wrote it above,
## Whether or not the region you are setting is in the low or high binding energy region (i.e. to the left or right of the peak),
## And what the start and stop points are for the region, NOTE the step size of your XPS data, and use only values divisible by that step

#### SET CORRECTED CRSF VALUES (Obtained from Multipak)
## CRSF == 'Corrected Relative Sensitivity Factor', needed to obtain At%
## You can obtain the CRSF values in multipak through the summary.txt table output
## Write CRSF values in the following format 'x, y, z'
## Where x, y, z and the CRSF values corresponding to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd element listed above in the elements list
>>> 87.775, 205.026, 279.795, 50.283, 76.549, 84.135, 96.962, 168.940, 228.568, 301.547, 495.706, 598.542 


#### HOW TO RUN ERROR ANALYSIS
## This can only be done after running Region.py, or setting all regions manually
## 
>>> python Composition.py
