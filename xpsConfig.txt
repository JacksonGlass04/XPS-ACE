#### DO NOT REMOVE ANY '>' characters

## To see how to run this program, consult the Read Me

#### SELECT DATA TO BE ANALYZED
## In the following format, omitting quotation marks: 'Filename.csv'
>>> EdgarEastSpectrum.csv


#### ELEMENTS TO ANALYZE / PEAK CENTERS
## Open the file "Data_Table.csv", and write the element/transition, peak center, and CRSF value for each transition, with one element per row


#### HOW TO OUTPUT PLOTS OF REGION FOR BACKGROUND POINT SELECTION
## To output plots of background point regions, run the file 'Region.py' in the terminal, with the command given below
## Please review the selected regions, if you wish to change them manually, see the following section
>>> python Region.py


#### MANUALLY SET BACKGROUND REGION HERE
## To manually set a region, include the following information 'Transition_Name, Low_Or_High_Region, Starting_Energy, Ending_Energy'
## Include the name of the transition, identical to how you wrote it above,
## As an example, 'Fe2p, Low, 702.5, 706.5, Fe2p, High, 718.5, 722.5' would create a high and low custom region for the Fe2p transition 
## NOTE the step size of your XPS data, and use only values divisible by that step size (i.e. 0.5eV for a survey)
>>> Fe2p, Low, 702.5, 706.5, Fe2p, High, 718.5, 722.5


#### TO SAVE CUSTOMIZED REGIONS 
## Run the following command
>>> python Control.py -custom_region True


#### IMPORTANT NOTE ON RELATIVE SENSITIVITY FACTORS -- PLEASE READ
## Each XPS Setup has different Corrected Relative Sensitivity Factors (CRSF), which are needed to calculate atomic %
## From your summary.txt output from Multipak, ensure that the CRSF values match those in Data_Table.csv
## If you do not do this, the results will be incorrect!!


#### HOW TO RUN ERROR ANALYSIS
## This can only be done after running Region.py, or setting all regions manually
## 
>>> python Composition.py


#### HOW TO DISPLAY YOUR RESULTS
## You can create a plot of At% results of your XPS analysis
## This program allows you to customize the filetype, and plot scale
## To see options, run the following command, which will tell you how to run the program with desired input
>>> python Display.py -h
