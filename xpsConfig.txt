#### CONFIG FILE FOR XPS ERROR BAR CALCULATION

#### LABORATORY FOR ASTROPHYSICS AND SURFACE PHYSICS AT UVA,
#### JACKSON GLASS,
#### 2024,

#### DO NOT REMOVE ANY '>' characters

## To see how to run this program, consult the Read Me

#### SELECT DATA TO BE ANALYZED
## In the following format, omitting quotation marks: 'Filename.csv'
>>> sulfide_test.csv


#### ELEMENTS TO ANALYZE / PEAK CENTERS
## Open the file "enstatite_demo.table" with notepad, and write the element/transition, peak center, and CRSF value for each transition, with one element per row


#### HOW TO OUTPUT PLOTS OF REGION FOR BACKGROUND POINT SELECTION
## To output plots of background point regions, run the file 'Region.py' in the terminal, with the command given below
## Please review the selected regions, if you wish to change them manually, see the following section
>>> python Region.py


#### MANUALLY SET BACKGROUND REGION HERE
## To manually set a region, include the following information 'Transition_Name, Low_Or_High_Region, Starting_Energy, Ending_Energy'
## Include the name of the transition, identical to how you wrote it in "Filename.table",
## NOTE: only use values divisible by the step size of your spectrum
### Fe2p3, Low, 701.2, 713.2, Fe2p3, High, 718.2, 722.2
>>> Ca2p, Low, 340.0, 341.0, Ca2p, High, 349.6, 351.0
### O1s, Low, 521, 524, O1s, High, 534, 536
### S2p, Low, 154, 156, S2p, High, 163, 165


#### TO SAVE CUSTOMIZED REGIONS 
## Run the following command
>>> python control.py -cr


#### IMPORTANT NOTE ON RELATIVE SENSITIVITY FACTORS -- PLEASE READ
## Each XPS Setup has different Corrected Relative Sensitivity Factors (CRSF), which are needed to calculate atomic %
## From your summary.txt output from Multipak, ensure that the CRSF values match those in Data_Table.csv
## If you do not do this, the results will be incorrect!!


#### HOW TO RUN ERROR ANALYSIS
## This can only be done after running Region.py, or setting all regions manually
## 
>>> python Composition.py


#### HOW TO DISPLAY YOUR RESULTS
## You can create a plot of At% results of your XPS analysis
## This program allows you to customize the filetype, and plot scale
## To see options, run the following command, which will tell you how to run the program with desired input
>>> python Display.py -h
